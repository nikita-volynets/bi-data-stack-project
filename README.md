## DBT project architecture

### Layers

The project consists of 3 layers:

**1. Sources:** These tables are the starting point. Small adjustments are made, such as changing the names of columns, but not much else.

**2. Transform:** In this step, the data from the "Sources" goes through more complex changes. It includes combining tables, performing calculations, and organizing the data. It is divided into two parts:
- Raptors: This section focuses on data specifically about the Toronto Raptors team.
- Teams: This section deals with data about all teams.

**3. Marts:** These tables are the finished product, ready for people to use. They come in two sub-folders:
- Business: Aimed at professionals who need to analyze data or make visualizations and dashboards, like business stakeholders or data analysts.
- Fans: Designed for NBA fans who want to explore and analyze the data for fun.
